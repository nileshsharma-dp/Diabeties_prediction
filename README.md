# Diabeties_prediction
The Diabetes Prediction Model uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on factors like age, glucose levels, BMI, and insulin. The model is trained on health data, optimized through cross-validation, and helps identify individuals at risk for early diabetes detection.
